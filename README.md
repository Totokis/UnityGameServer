### Unity Game Server made for my new project.
I started this project to learn how networking stuff works, its totally based on
networking tutorial series from this guy:
[Tom Weiland](https://youtu.be/uh8XaC0Y5MA).

This is not completed version, I was trying to host this on PlayFab, but this was not a 
good idea, now I'm switching back, in future I will host this on other service like
Digital Ocean or smth like that.
